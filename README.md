## Introduction
A simple to do or what I called is a Task Tracker App using React framework. Try it [here](https://patwadeepak.github.io/task-tracker-react/).
I have implemented the local storage feature. Meaning all data remains with your browser only and it remembers it even if open it after some days.
One can actually use it regularly by just bookmarking the link in browser.

## Purpose
I made it for learning purpose and it works pretty well if you use it with a json server backend.

## Usage
Notice below lines of code in [`src\index.js`](https://github.com/patwadeepak/task-tracker-react/blob/master/src/index.js) -
<br>
`
import App from './App'`<br>`
// import App from './AppWithBackendCode'
`
<br>
Just swap them and you get a json server backend too.

## Planned features
Learning happens only when you actually develop useful features. I have plans to add localStorage support so anyone using a browser can directly use it without json server backend and have persistent data across page refresh.

Basically no swapping as mentioned and in [usage](https://github.com/patwadeepak/task-tracker-react#usage) and no need to run a json backend server.
##### PS: I think the UI is quite large just Zoom out to 80% for now. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
