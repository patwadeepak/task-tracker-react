## Introduction
A simple app to keep track of some tasks at hand developed using React. [Try here](https://patwadeepak.github.io/task-tracker-react/).<br>
I have implemented the local storage feature. Meaning all data remains with your browser only.<br>
Task Tracker will remember the tasks even if you open it after some days using same browser.

#### Want to use it regularly ? Just bookmark it

## Purpose
I made it for learning purpose and it works pretty well you know.

## Usage
Notice below lines of code in [`src\index.js`](https://github.com/patwadeepak/task-tracker-react/blob/master/src/index.js) -
<br>
`
import App from './App'`<br>`
// import App from './AppWithBackendCode'
`
<br>
Just swap them and you get a json server backend too.

## Planned features
Learning happens only when you actually develop useful features.<br>
Local Storage - Done<br>
Dark Theme - Pending<br>

##### PS: I think the UI is quite large just Zoom out to 80% for now. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
